# Progress Log

## 2025-02-09: Mode Configuration Updates

### Completed
1. Updated all mode configuration files:
   - Improved Memory Bank file handling
   - Added explicit tool usage instructions
   - Enhanced task completion behavior

2. Specific Improvements:
   - ALL modes now read ALL Memory Bank files on startup
   - Added mode-specific handling for missing core files
   - Removed unnecessary attempt_completion usage
   - Added clear next step suggestions

### Latest Updates (2025-02-09 19:58)
1. **Autonomous Mode Switching**
   - Discovered and implemented automatic mode switching capability
   - Added mode switching rules to all .clinerules files
   - Created formal specification in `mode-switching-spec.md`

2. **README Improvements**
   - Enhanced formatting and readability
   - Added Mermaid diagrams for visual clarity
   - Updated documentation for mode switching

### Next Steps
1. Test the updated configurations in real usage:
   - Verify file reading behavior
   - Test missing file handling
   - Monitor task completion flow
   - Validate autonomous mode switching

2. Gather feedback on:
   - User experience with new completion behavior
   - Effectiveness of missing file handling
   - Overall system reliability

### Known Issues
- None currently identified


This document tracks the progress of the Roo Code Memory Bank project.

## Work Done

### February 9, 2025 - Memory Bank File Handling Improvements
- Revised Memory Bank file handling approach:
  - Defined four core Memory Bank files
  - Removed specific filename searches from .clinerules
  - Implemented more flexible Memory Bank detection
  - Moved projectBrief.md to project root
  - Added user prompts for creating missing core files
- Updated documentation to reflect new Memory Bank structure
- Improved support for existing projects with different file organizations

### February 9, 2025 - Enhanced Roo Mode Behaviors
- Created comprehensive mode configuration files (.clinerules-*) for all three modes
- Added explicit instructions for Memory Bank initialization and usage
- Implemented consistent behavior across modes:
  - Immediate reading of all Memory Bank files on activation
  - Restricted use of attempt_completion directive
  - Added task presentation based on Memory Bank content
  - Improved user interaction flow
- Added detailed UMB (Update Memory Bank) procedures for each mode

### Previous Work
- Created and populated initial Memory Bank structure
- Implemented basic Memory Bank detection and initialization
- Developed initial mode-specific rules and responsibilities
- Created documentation framework
- Resolved various tool-related issues and bugs

### Completed in Current Session (2025-02-09)

#### Mode Definition Improvements
- Completely revised role definitions for all three modes:
  - Architect: Strategic leader for system design and documentation
  - Code: Implementation-focused developer
  - Ask: Knowledge assistant and documentation analyzer
- Added explicit responsibilities and collaboration patterns
- Clarified file authority for each mode

#### Memory Bank System Enhancements
- Standardized Memory Bank detection process across all modes
- Added explicit tool calling syntax in rules
- Implemented clear mode-specific responses to Memory Bank states
- Improved status prefix handling (`[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE/INACTIVE]`)

#### Rule File Updates
- Updated all `.clinerules-xxx` files with improved structure
- Added standardized Memory Bank detection procedures
- Clarified mode collaboration patterns
- Enhanced UMB process documentation

## Current Status

Mode definitions and Memory Bank management rules have been significantly improved. The system is ready for testing with the new rules to verify improved reliability and clarity in mode interactions. Next step is to test the revised system with Roo to validate the changes.
